# Outline

## Repository Structure & Content Review

Review the content of the repository, particularly the R scripts and console outputs. 

Identify key parts of the project to showcase, such as:

- Script explanations
- Project summaries
- Data visualizations or results from the R scripts

## Plan Website Structure

- Home Page: Overview of the internship, goals, and main focus.
- Projects: Descriptions of each project, including R code and console outputs.
- Code Repository: A section that links to or embeds the R code from GitHub.
- Documentation/Blog: Any notes or documentation related to the hackbio internship. Anecdotes eventually.
- About/Contact: Information about me, my teammates, and contact details.
  
## Frontend Development (HTML/CSS/JS)

*HTML*: Use HTML to create page layouts.

Home Page Layout: start with a basic homepage that introduces the hackbio internship, with links to other sections.

*CSS*: Style the website for clarity and presentation.

- Create a consistent design by defining a color scheme, fonts, and layout rules in a style.css file. Make sure itâ€™s responsive (works on different devices) by using a framework like Bootstrap or writing my own media queries.
- Header: Title and navigation links to other sections.
- Main Content: Highlight important internship details.
- Footer: Links to your GitHub repository and other relevant pages.

Color palette: sage green, white, black.

JavaScript: Enable interactivity (e.g., dynamically load R script outputs or toggle visibility of content).

## Dynamic Content (JavaScript or Django)

*Option 1: JavaScript (Client-Side Rendering)*

Write a JavaScript script that reads raw R code and outputs it in a formatted way.
Use JavaScript to display logs/outputs dynamically on the webpage.
JSON could be used to store structured data (e.g., R code metadata) that JavaScript can parse and render dynamically.

*Option 2: Django (Server-Side Rendering)*

Install Django and create a project that fetches content from the repository.
Define Django templates for each section (homepage, script page, etc.).
Use Django views to load R scripts and console outputs from the repo, displaying them in a structured format.

## Integrating Repository Content

R Code Integration: Embed formatted R code into HTML using code blocks. Provide dynamic links to each script stored in your GitHub repository.

Results: dynamically display figures or tables generated from R scripts using <img> or table elements.

Console Outputs: Use <pre> tags to show console logs in a readable format.

## Deploying the Website

Can deploy it using GitHub Pages (if using static HTML/CSS/JS) or a service like Heroku for dynamic Django-based sites.

Note: I used ChatGPT in order to guide me into a direction.
